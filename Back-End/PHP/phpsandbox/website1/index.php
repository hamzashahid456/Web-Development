<?php include 'inc/header.php'; ?>
    <h1>Home</h1>
<?php include 'inc/footer.php'; ?>



    <!-- we can also use 'require' instead of include
    difference is that it will not load the script below if error in requiring file
    And in include, if error in file, it will still run the script below -->
